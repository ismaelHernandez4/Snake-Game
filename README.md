# Snake-Game
This is a classic Snake Game and my very first project on GitHub. I developed it using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate some foundational web development skills. The gameplay is simple and intuitive: use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the snake around the grid. Your goal is to eat as many pieces of food as possible, and with each bite, your score increases by 10 points while the snake grows longer. Try to avoid crashing into the walls or your own tail!
